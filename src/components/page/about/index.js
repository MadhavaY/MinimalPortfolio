          A Computer Science graduate student with interests in Machine Learning
          and front-end development. School has really helped build my interest
          in developing smart systems while making sure they're usable at the
          same time. I just love combining technical problem-solving with the
          creativity of designing interfaces with strong knowledge in algorithms
          and programming. I look forward to creating new applications, using
          those skills to push beyond what is possible in both AI and web
          development.{" "}
