          A Computer Science graduate student with interests in
          Machine Learning and front-end development. School has really helped
          build my interest in developing smart systems while making sure
          they're usable at the same time. I just love combining technical
          problem-solving with the creativity of designing interfaces with
          strong knowledge in algorithms and programming. I look forward to
          creating new applications, using those skills to push beyond what is
          possible in both AI and web development.{" "}
